# Sample .env file #
#
# First save this file as `.env`, ignoring any system warnings you get against naming it that way.
#
# Then, generate a local Django secret key by going back to your shell/cmd prompt and doing:
# `python manage.py shell -c "from django.core.management import utils; print(utils.get_random_secret_key())"`
#
# Then paste the key you get below:

SECRET_KEY="paste-key-here"
