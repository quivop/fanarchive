If you can't think of a short, descriptive title, you can put the user story in the issue title, like so:

> `As a <user type>, I want to <task> so that <goal>`

Example:

> `As a fanfic reader, I want to subscribe to favorite authors so that I can follow their work`

Don't forget to delete all this helper text!

## User story
Expand on the user story here, if needed.

## Acceptance criteria
E.g. from above:

- beside the fanfic author's name, there should be a 'subscribe' button
- pressing 'subscribe' should add that author to my subscription list
- when that author posts an update, I should get an email / site message
- I should be able to unsubscribe from any authors I no longer want to follow, through similar mechanisms to above
